# Scaffold-Pay  

Are you tired of Payment Processors taking a cut of you sales?  

Want to accept a custom token as payment for a product, but can't find a free payment flow to embed in your store?  

Scaffold-Pay is simple. You redirect users to the Scaffold-Pay site, passing in the paramaters, `home/tokenAddress/to/from/amount`, and it makes it simple for the user to pay.

The aim is to release a companion npm package that allows you to easily embed this in your shop's payment flow.  

Why add intermediaries when the chain is doing all the work already?

This is a proud BuidlGuidl build.
